# superposition theorem:
the current through or voltage across an element in a linear bilateral network is equal to the algebraic sum of the currents or voltages produced independently by each source
## steps:
1. find the **response** in the branch needed by considering only *one independent* source and *killing* all the remaining independent sources
	voltage source $\rightarrow$ short circuit S.C
	current source $\rightarrow$ open circuit O.C
2. repeat step one for all independent sources in the circuit
3. add all the **responses** to get the overall response in the branch
	"responses" = current or voltage *NOT* power
dependent sources can *NOT* be killed

<center>"it's possible to simplify any <strong>linear and bilateral </strong> part of a circuit - no matter how complex - to an equivalent circuit with:- "</center>
<div class="xtable"  style="ta: center;">
	<div><h1>Thevenin theorem</h1>a single <i>voltage</i> source and a <b>series</b> resistance</div>
	<div><h1>Norton theorem:</h1>a single <i>current</i> source and a <b>parallel</b> resistance</div>
</div>

use them to simplify the circuit in order to be left with just the source, resistor and the connected branch to get the current or voltage drop on it
## steps:
1. crop the branch which we want to test on and let the points that the branch is on be a and b
2. **Thevenin** find $V_{th}$ by finding the voltage drop between a and b
3. **Norton** find $I_n$ by connecting a S.C though a and b and finding the current passing through
4. find $R_{th}$ (*same resistance for both methods*) by either: <br>
	1. kill all the independent sources in the circuit and find the equivalent resistance
	2. kill all the independent sources and place a test voltage source $V_T$ that gives a current $I_T$ and get $R_{th} = \dfrac{V_T}{I_T}$
	3. divide $V_{th}$ by $I_n$ <br>
5. after calculating both, connect the removed branch with the Thevenin/Norton equivalent of the circuit
# Maximum power transfer
"A resistive load receives maximum power from a linear bilateral DC network if **the load resistance** equals the **Thevenin's resistance** of the network"
after getting $R_{th}$ , assume the load resistance $R_L$ 
to get the max power, $R_L=R_{th}$ 
now we're left with 2 resistances $R_{th}$ and voltage source $V_{th}$
$$
P_\text{max} = I^2R_{th} = \left( \dfrac{V_{th}}{2R_{th}}\right)^2 R_{th}= \dfrac{ {V_{th}}^2 }{ 4 {R_{th}}^2} R_{th}
$$
$$
P_\text{max}= \dfrac{ {V_{th}}^2 }{ 4 R_{th}}
$$
