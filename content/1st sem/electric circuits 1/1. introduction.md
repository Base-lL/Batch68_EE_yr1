not much to note here. I'll get what i think might be important
- **Protons**: Positively charged atomic particles ,mass $(1.672\times10^{-24} g)$
- **Neutrons**: Uncharged atomic particles, mass $(1.672\times10^{-24} g)$
- **Electrons**: negatively charged particles, mass $(9.112\times10^{-28} g)$

| **orbit number** | **Maximum electrons** |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| 1                | 2                     |
| 2                | 8                     |
| 3                | 18                    |

| 5                | 50                    |
| 6                | 70                    |
| $n$              | $2n^2$                |
- The symbol for **electric charge** is Q or q, for quantity.
- 1 coulomb (C) is equal to the quantity (Q) of $6.25 × 10^{18}$ electrons / protons
- the charge of a single electron = the charge of a single proton = $1.6 × 10^{-19}$ 
	+$Q_p$ : proton                      +$Q_e$ : electron       
- $F\;\text{(attraction/repulsion force)}= \frac{k\,Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$ , k = $9.0\times10^9$
- **current** $I$ is the amount of charge Q (in coulombs) flowing per unit time t (in seconds): $\large I = \frac{Q}{t}$ and it's unit is 1A = 1 C/s
- a **potential difference** of 1 $V$  exists between 2 points if 1 joule (J) of energy is exchange in moving 1 coulomb (C) of charge between the 2 points, $\large V = \frac{W}{Q}$ 
- **Power** is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in watts (W) OR is the rate at which work is done 
- $P = \dfrac{W}{t} = \dfrac{VQ}{t} =V\,I$
