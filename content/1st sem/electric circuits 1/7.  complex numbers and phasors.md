- *real* numbers are the ones we use and are present on the number line.
- *imaginary* numbers are multiples of $\sqrt{-1}$ and are represented in $j$. reason why not in $i$ is because it is used in current.
- imaginary numbers are not present on the number line, instead a separate number line perpendicular to the normal number line is used.
- **complex numbers** are the sum of real and imaginary numbers.

Imaginary numbers are useful for many reasons
- it has many forms to switch into to ease the equations
- a complex number can be represent coordinates in a cartesian plane
- a complex number can represent a vector
- can easily represent **rotation**

***important:*** do the math on a calculator (please)
- \[mode] 2 for complex mode
- \[Eng] for $i$
- old calculators: \[shift] \[2] \[3] to switch into polar form
- new calculators: \[mode] \[down button] \[1]
# different forms
## Rectangular form : 
$$
\large3+j4 \Rightarrow x+jy
$$
your standard coordinate system on a Cartesian plane.
## Addition
$$
(a_1+jb_1) + (a_2+jb_2) = (a_1+a_2)+j(b_1+b_2)
$$
just add the terms
## multiplication
$$
(a_1+jb_1) + (a_2+jb_2) = (a_1a_2 - b_1b_2) + j(a_1b_2 + b_2a_1)
$$
## division
$$
\dfrac{a_1+jb_1}{a_2+jb_2} = \dfrac{a_1+jb_1}{a_2+jb_2} \cdot \dfrac{a_2-jb_2}{a_2-jb_2} = \dfrac{ (a_1+jb_1)(a_2-jb_2) }{a_2^2-b_2^2}
$$
you will need to multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* (المرافق) which is the denominator term with opposite $j$ sign
## Polar form : 
$$
8\angle20\degree \Rightarrow r\angle\theta
$$

$r :$ magnitude
$\theta :$ phase angle
## polar form transformation
$$
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \;,\quad \theta=\tan^{-1} \dfrac{y}{x}
$$
$$
x = r\cos\theta \;,\quad y = r \sin\theta
$$
## multiplication
$$
(r_1 \angle\theta_1)\;\cdot\;(r_2 \angle\theta_2) = r_1r_2 \angle(\theta_1+\theta_2)
$$
## division
$$
\dfrac{r_1 \angle\theta_1}{r_2 \angle\theta_2} = \dfrac{r_1}{r_2}\angle(\theta_1-\theta_2)
$$
note that multiplication and division are easier in polar form
## Addition
there is *no way* to add polar forms together, you have to **transform into rectangular form** then solve 
## exponential form : 
$$
\large 8\,e^{j20\degree} \Rightarrow A e^{j\theta}
$$
same as polar form, but it is a mathematical expression rather than notation.
**multiplication:** $\large A_1A_2\;e^{j(\theta_1+\theta_2)}$
**division:** $\large\dfrac{A_1}{A_2} e^{j(\theta_1-\theta_2)}$
**addition:** transform to rectangular
## note:
$$
a = a\cdot e^{j\,0} \quad,\quad jb = b\cdot e^{j\,\pi/2}
$$
## Euler's identity
$$
A e^{j\theta} = A \cos \theta + jA \sin\theta
$$
this can be used to to get trigonometric rules, better seen with an example.
let's say you want to get $\cos(2\theta)$, using Euler's identity with $2\theta$:
$$
e^{j(2\theta)} = \cos2\theta + j \sin 2\theta
$$
$$
\begin{align}
e^{j(2\theta)} = \left(e^{j\theta}\right)^2 &= (\cos2\theta + j \sin 2\theta)^2\\&= \left(\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta \right) + j(2\sin\theta\cos\theta)
\end{align}
$$
the solution for $\cos$ is the real component, which indeed $\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta$ 
this also holds for $\sin$ , when we look at the imaginary component it is the same as $\sin(2\theta) = (2\sin\theta\cos\theta)$ 
**Euler's identity can turn equations with trigonometric properties into ones with  exponent properties**

# Phasors
a phasor is a rotating vector that can be used to represent AC quantities
it is a complex number that represents phase difference between sinusoidal quantity using vectors (which is where the word came from, *phas*e-vect*ors*  )
![[Pasted image 20260118233436.png]]
- $V_2$ leads $V_1$ leads $V_0$
- the 3 phasors have equal magnitude but different phase (out of phase)
- a phasor with higher magnitude is represented by a longer vector
## note
- vectors have a magnitude and a *direction*
- phasors have a magnitude and a displacement or *phase* from a specific reference (usually $\theta = 0$)
- phasors are written in polar form
## usage
we can use phasors to find the sum and differences of sinusoids of same frequency by:
1. convert all sinusoids to **sine** term *(not cosine  or cosine + sin)*
2. for each sine term, form a complex number in polar form
3. implement the operation (you can change the form to rectangular for easier addition/subtraction )
4. convert back from phasor to sine
$$
A\sin(\omega t + \theta) \rightarrow \dfrac{A}{\sqrt2}\angle\theta
$$
divide by $\sqrt2$ for RMS value 
## note
- when changing to phasor, you divide by $\sqrt2$ 
- when you change back to wave form, you multiply by $\sqrt2$
