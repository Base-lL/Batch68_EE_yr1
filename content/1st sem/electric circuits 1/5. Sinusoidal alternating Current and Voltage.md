		<h2>Periodic wave</h2>
		<p>A wave that varies with time such that it repeats itself after a fixed time called the period</p>
	</div>
	<div> 
		<h2>Alternating wave</h2>
		<p>a type of <i>periodic wave</i> that varies with time such that it is positive for a portion of a cycle and negative for the reminder of the cycle</p>

#### Note
every **Alternating** wave is a **period** wave
but *not* every **periodic** wave is **alternating**

Sine, triangle and square are alternating
saw-tooth and sine with offset (bottom one) are not alternating
# Sine wave properties
$v(t)$ : instantaneous voltage value | the voltage at a time $t$
$V_m$ : maximum value | peak value $V_p$
$V_{pp}$ : peak-to-peak value = $2V_m$
$f$ : frequency ; number of cycles per second *Hz ; Hertz*
$\omega$ : radian frequency *rad / sec*
$T$ : period | periodic time ; duration of one cycle *time*
$$
\omega = 2\pi f \qquad,\qquad T = \dfrac 1 f 
$$
# General form of sinusoidal voltage & current
$$
v(t) = V_m \sin(\omega t + \theta) \quad,\quad i(t) = I_m \sin(\omega t + \theta)
$$
$$
\theta : \text{Phase angle } , \qquad \text{Angle at $t$ = 0 }\rightarrow v(0) = V_m \sin(\theta) 
$$


# Phase relation
for the 2 waves:
$$
v_1(t) = V_m \sin(\omega t + \theta_1) \qquad,\qquad v_2(t) = V_m \sin(\omega t + \theta_2)
$$
**phase difference**: $\large \phi = \theta_1 - \theta_2$ 
it is said that
$v_2$ lags $v_1$ by angle $\phi$ *OR* $v_1$ leads $v_2$ by angle $\phi$ (assuming $\theta_2$ is smaller)
# Average value
the average value is equal to the *area between the wave and the x axis* ***-or the integration of the wave function over one period-*** divided by *that time period*.
$$
V_\text{avg} = \dfrac{\text{area of the wave in on cycle}}{\text{period of one cycle}} = \dfrac 1 T \int_0^T v(t)dt
$$
**NOTE**: when getting the average time, you need to get the periodic time of *one cycle*.
look in the wave for repeating pattern to identify the cycle
# Effective value / RMS value
the effective value of a periodic voltage or current equals the value of a DC voltage or current that would produce the same average power loss in a resistor (heating effect) that the periodic voltage or current would
$$
\text{energy due to heat for a period $T$}=I_\text{eff}^2 R\,T = \int_0^T i^2(t) R\,dt
$$

$$
I_\text{eff}^2 \,T = \int_0^T i^2(t) \,dt \quad \Rightarrow I_\text{eff} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{T} \int^T_0 i^2(t)dt }
$$

note that RMS stands for "*R*oot *M*ean *S*quare" which are the operations used here.

## For a sinusoidal wave $i(t) = I_m \sin(\omega t)$ :
$$
I_\text{eff} = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{T} \int^T_0 I_m
^2 \, \sin^2(\omega t)dt }\; \xrightarrow{\text{do the math}} I_\text{eff} = \dfrac{I_m}{\sqrt2}
$$
we can deduce that for any sine wave, the **RMS value** is *peak value* / $\sqrt2$
$$
\large v_\text{eff} = v_\text{rms} = \dfrac{V_m}{\sqrt 2} \quad,\qquad I_\text{eff} = I_\text{rms} = \dfrac{I_m}{\sqrt 2}
$$
## To find the RMS of a wave
1. *Square* the periodic wave
2. Find the average (*Mean*) of the squared wave over one period
3. Take the square *Root* of the average

***IMPORTANT:*** the square of a function will *NOT* look like the original function. 
EX: when squaring a line function, it will *NOT* give a straight line, rather a parabola.
same applies for any non-constant function.
