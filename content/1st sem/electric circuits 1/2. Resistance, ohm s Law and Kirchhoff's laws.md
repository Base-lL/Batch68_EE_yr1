**Resistance** (the *property*) is anything that causes an opposition to the flow of current in a circuit.
**Resistor** (the *component*) is a device designed specifically to have a constant resistance.
# ohm's law: 
the current passing though a branch with resistance R and connected between 2 nodes $V_1$ and $V_2$
$$
\huge I = \frac{V_1-V_2}{R} =\frac{V}{R}
$$
Defines the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit and it states:
	Current in a resistor varies in direct proportion to the voltage applied	to it and is inversely proportional to the resistor’s value.
# power absorption:
$$
\large P =  VI = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2 R
$$
Positive power means the device is absorbing energy.
	power is always positive for a resistor
# Factors affecting resistance:
**Length**, L : Longer materials have *greater* $\uparrow$ resistance.
**Area**, A : Larger areas offer *less* $\downarrow$ resistance.
**Temperature**, T : Higher temperatures usually result in *higher* $\uparrow$ resistances.
**Material**: determines the resistivity, Iron has more electrical resistance than a geometrically similar copper conductor.

The resistance of a wire at *constant temperature* is determined by the **resistivity** ($\rho$) of the conductor as well as the geometry: 
$$
\large  R = \rho\,\frac{L}{A}
$$
The resistance of metallic conductors increases with *rise $\uparrow$ in temperature*. If $R_0$ is the resistance of a conductor at 0°C, $R_t$ at t°C and t is the rise in temperature, then : 
$$
\large R_t = R_o\,(1+\alpha_0\,t) \normalsize \quad,\quad\large \alpha_x = \frac{\alpha_0}{1+\alpha_0 \, t_x}
$$
where $\alpha_x$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance at $x\degree C$
same law for **resistivity** ($\rho$): $\large \rho_t = \rho_o\,(1+\alpha_0\,t)$
## conductance:
The *reciprocal of resistance* (1/R), which is called **conductance** ( symbol G, unit *siemens* (S) )
A resistor R has **conductance** G=1/R
The i-v equation (i.e. Ohm’s law) can be written as $\large I = V\,G$

# Topology of electric circuits

- **Branch:** it's any component in the circuit that is not an empty wire.
	branches with *no current* passing in them can be *removed* without affecting the circuit

- **Node:** the points that connect at least 2 branches together.
	nodes carry a voltage value on them
	nodes of the *same voltage* can be *combined* without affecting the circuit

- **Loop:** any closed path in the circuit.
- **Mesh:** any closed path (loop) that does not have a closed path in its interior
	   a loop without any branches inside it

- **Independent loops (L) / meshes** number is given by: L = b - n + 1
	b is the number of branches
	n is the number of circuit nodes
