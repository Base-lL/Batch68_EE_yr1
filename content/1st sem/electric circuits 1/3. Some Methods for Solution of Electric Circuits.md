# source transformation
Equivalent sources can be used to simplify the analysis of some circuits:
- A **voltage source** in *series* with a resistor(s) is transformed into a **current source** in *parallel* with a resistor.
	the resulting resistance should equal the total of all resistances between a and b
- A **current source** in *parallel* with a resistor(s) is transformed into a **voltage source** in *series* with a resistor.

$$
\large v_S = i_SR \qquad or \qquad i_S = \frac{v_s}{R}
$$
notice the resistance value does *NOT* change
# series connection:
- A series circuit is one in which Current passes through one Device *and then another*.
- Two or more elements are in series if they are cascaded or connected sequentially and consequently *carry the same current*.
- The equivalent resistance of any number of resistors connected in a series is the *sum of the individual resistances*. $$\large R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_N = \sum^N_{n=1}R_n $$
## Voltage Divider Rule (VDR):
for a circuit that has a voltage source $V_S$ and 2 resistances $R_1,\;R_2$ connected in series :
$$
\large V_1 = V_S \,\frac{R_1}{R_1 +R_2}\qquad,\qquad V_2 = V_S \,\frac{R_2}{R_1 +R_2}
$$
$$
\text{generally:}\quad V_n = V \,\frac{R_n}{R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_N}
$$
**the voltage drop** across a resistance $R_n$ equals the total voltage drop $V_n$ times its resistance *in series* over the sum of all other resistances 
it's valid for *any* number of resistances in series
# parallel connection:
- A parallel circuit is one with *Several current paths*, whose Total current equals the sum of the Currents in its branches.
- Two or more elements are in parallel if they are *connected to the same two nodes* and consequently *have the same voltage* across them
- The equivalent resistance of any number of resistors connected in parallel is the inverse of the sum of the inverses of every resistance $$\large R_{eq} = \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{1}{R_1} + \dfrac{1}{R_2} + \cdots+\dfrac{1}{R_N}} $$
- The total current i is shared by the resistors in inverse proportion to their resistances. The current divider can be expressed as: $$ \large I_n=\frac{V}{R_n} = \frac{IR_{eq}}{R_n} \qquad \text{for ratios : } \quad \frac{I_n}{I} = \frac{R}{R_n}$$
## Current divider rule (CDR):
for 2 resistances $R_1,\;R_2$ connected in parallel and a total current $I$ is entering
$$
\large R_{eq}=\frac{R_1\,R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \qquad , \qquad I_1=\frac{IR_2}{R_1 + R_2} \qquad , \qquad I_2=\frac{IR_1}{R_1 + R_2}
$$
$$
\text{generally:}\quad I_n = I \times\dfrac{R_{eq}}{R_n}
$$
**the current** pathing through a resistance equals the total current $I$ multiplied by *the other resistance* over the sum of the 2 resistances, it's valid for *only 2* parallel resistances in parallel, else use the general rule
# star / delta connections

$$
\large\begin{array}{c|c}\\
\text{Delta $\rightarrow$ Star}  & \text{Delta $\leftarrow$ Star} \\[15px]
\hline
R_a = \dfrac{R_{ab}\,R_{ca}}{ R_{ab} + R_{bc} + R_{ca} } & R_{ab} = R_a + R_b + \dfrac{R_a\,R_b}{R_c} \\[10px]
R_b = \dfrac{R_{ab}\,R_{bc}}{ R_{ab} + R_{bc} + R_{ca} } & R_{bc} = \dfrac{R_b\,R_c}{R_a} + R_b + R_c \\[10px]
R_c = \dfrac{R_{bc}\,R_{ca}}{ R_{ab} + R_{bc} + R_{ca} } & R_{ca} =  R_a + \dfrac{R_c\,R_a}{R_b} + R_c \\[10px]
R_S = \dfrac{1}{3} R_D & R_D = 3 R_S
\end{array}
$$
## bridge connection
![[Pasted image 20251021170358.png]]
- solved by converting one connection from delta to star, results in a parallel connection with a resistance in series
- If the bridge center branch carries *no current*, the bridge is said to be **balanced** (R5 in these cases)
- a bridge is also balanced in the case: $\dfrac{R_1}{R_2} =\dfrac{R_3}{R_4}$



# Millman theorem
![[milliman-theorem-fig-1-compressor.jpg]]

for 'n' resistances and voltage sources connected in series, all connected in parallel, they can all be combined into just one branch where: 
$$
R_T = \dfrac{1}{\sum^n_{i=1} \dfrac{1}{R_i}} = \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{1}{R_1} + \dfrac{1}{R_2} + \cdots+\dfrac{1}{R_n}} \qquad,\qquad V_T = R_T\;\sum^n_{i=1}\dfrac{V_i}{R_i}
$$

# mesh analysis (loop current method)
![[Pasted image 20251031104859.png]]
1. transform all current sources to voltage sources (if possible)
2. identify and assign a current to each mesh
3. write mesh equations and solve them
the general form of the equation is:
	voltage sources in the loop direction - that of the opposite direction
	= for each resistance in the mesh, the resistance times (the current in the mesh direct - that of the opposite direction )
# nodal analysis
![[Pasted image 20251031112201.png]]
1. transform all voltage sources to current sources (if possible)
2. identify and assign voltage to each node and take one node as reference (its voltage = 0)
3. write nodal equations and solve them:
	current entering the node - current leaving = node's voltage * ( the inverse of each resistance connected to it ) - the connected resistances * voltage of nodes connected to them on the other end
$$
V_{\text{node}}\,(\frac{1}{R_1} +\frac{1}{R_2} +\frac{1}{R_3}) \;-V_1 (\frac{1}{R_1})\;-V_2 (\frac{1}{R_2})\;-V_3 (\frac{1}{R_3}) = I_{\text{node}}
$$
what the equations will look like somewhat
