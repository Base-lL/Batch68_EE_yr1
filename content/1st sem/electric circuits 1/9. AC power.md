in an AC circuit, the power -much like to the impedance- has real and imaginary components which are described as:
$$
S = P + jQ
$$
which are going to be defined next
# Instantaneous power
$$
\begin{array}{l l l}
P &= V_\text{eff} I_\text{eff} \cos\theta \; (1 - \cos 2\omega t) &\qquad \leftarrow \text{average power $P_\text{avg}$} \\[5px]
&+ V_\text{eff} I_\text{eff} \sin\theta \; (\sin 2\omega t) & \qquad \leftarrow \text{reactive power $Q$} \\
\end{array}
$$
when taking the average of $P$ , since the average of a sinusoidal wave is zero, all terms cancel except $P_\text{avg}$ (will be referred to as $P$ later)  
the average of the reactive power is zero, it is defined as having peak value $V_\text{eff} I_\text{eff} \sin\theta$


# Active power $P$
*or average power - real power*
- the complex power component that is responsible for doing actual useful work (converted to light, heat, motion, etc...)
- consumed in resistors
- measured in **Watt** (W)
$$
P = V_\text{eff} I_\text{eff} \cos\theta \quad,\quad \text{where: $\theta$ is the same as $Z$ } \;,\quad\theta = \theta_V - \theta_I
$$
notice that $\theta$ is a constant term doesn't change with time or cycle.
So, Power is constant
## for the power passing through a resistor R:
$$
P = I^2_\text{eff} R = \dfrac{V^2_\text{eff}}{R}
$$
since $R = |Z|\cos\theta$ 
$$
P = I^2_\text{eff}|Z|\cos\theta
$$
also $I_\text{eff} = V_\text{eff} |Y_T|$ 
$$
p = V_\text{eff} \left(V_\text{eff} \, |Y_T|\right) \cos(-\theta)
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle of $Y_T$ *( remember that $\theta_Y = -\theta_Z$ )* 
$$
\because \cos\theta = \cos-\theta \quad,\quad |Y_T|\cos(\theta) = G_T 
$$

$$
P= {V_\text{eff}}^2 \,G_T \qquad G_T \ne \dfrac{1}{R}
$$
$\cos\theta$ is called the **power factor** (P.F)

# Reactive power $Q$
*or Quadrature power - imaginary power*
- Reactive power doesn't directly perform useful work, but it is necessary for the operation of equipment and machines that rely on magnetic or electric fields.
- it is necessary for magnetic field creation in inductors and electric field in capacitors
- it is measured in **VAR** : Volt-Ampere-Reactive
$$
Q = V_\text{eff} I_\text{eff} \sin\theta  \quad,\quad Q = I^2_\text{eff} X = \dfrac{V^2_\text{eff}}{X}
$$
since $X = |Z|\sin\theta$ 
$$
Q = I^2_\text{eff}|Z|\sin\theta
$$
also $I_\text{eff} = V_\text{eff} |Y_T|$ 
$$
\begin{array}{l}
Q = V_\text{eff} \left(V_\text{eff} \, |Y_T|\right) \sin\theta \\
\because \sin-\theta = -\sin\theta \quad,\quad |Y_T|\sin(\theta) = B_T \\
Q= -{V_\text{eff}}^2 \,G_T \qquad G_T \ne \dfrac{1}{R}
\end{array}
$$
$\sin\theta$ is called the **reactive factor**
# Complex power $S$
$$
Z = R + jX
$$
$$
I^2_\text{eff} Z = I^2_\text{eff}R +I^2_\text{eff} jX
$$
$$
\because I^2_\text{eff}R = P \quad,\quad I^2_\text{eff} X = Q
$$
$$
I^2_\text{eff} Z = P + jQ
$$
$$
S = P + jQ
$$
we can then deduce that:

$$
P = |S|\cos\theta \quad,\quad Q = |S|\sin\theta
$$

$$
S = V_\text{eff}I_\text{eff}
$$

to express the angle of $\vec S$ , we need the conjugate on $I$ to add negative sign to the angle, so:

$$
\vec S = \vec V \vec I^*
$$
## quick summery
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\vec S = P + jQ = \vec V \vec I^* = |\vec S| \angle\theta \\
|\vec S| = \sqrt{P^2 + Q^2} = |\vec V|\,|\vec I|\\[5px]
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left( \dfrac{Q}{P} \right) \quad,\quad
	\begin{array}{l}
	P = |\vec S| \cos \theta\\
	Q = |\vec S| \sin \theta\\
	\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

**Note** that all $V$ and $I$ used are *RMS* values
