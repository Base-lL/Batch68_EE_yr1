## electric flux lines "$\psi$":
the number of electric flux lines exist or enter the charges depend on their values: $\psi = Q$
## electric flux density "D":
$$ 
\vec D = \dfrac{\psi}{\text{area}}\,\vec{a_D} \qquad \text{OR} \qquad \vec D = \dfrac{\psi}{\iint dS}\,\vec{a_D} 
$$
# Gauss law:
the number of **flux lines** $\psi$ crossing a *closed surface* is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface
$$
\psi = Q_\text{enclosed} = \oint_\text{surface} \vec D \cdot \vec{dS}
$$
**Gauss Law** can solve equations much faster than **Coulomb's Law**, but *ONLY* if the charge distribution has High *Symmetry*.

when finding the surface for gauss law, focus on 2 things:
1. The Electric Field is *constant* on that surface.
2. The Electric Field points *straight through* (perpendicular to) that surface.
## point charge:
the surface that satisfies gauss law is a *sphere*: $\large\vec D = \dfrac{Q}{4\pi R^2} \vec{a_R}$
## infinite line charge "$\rho_L$":
the surface that satisfies gauss law is a *cylinder*: $\large\vec{D} = \dfrac{\rho_L}{2 \pi \rho}\vec{a_\rho}$
## infinite sheet charge "$\rho_S$":
the surface that satisfies gauss law is *2 parallel sheets*  (above and below the sheet): $\large\vec{D} = \dfrac{\rho_S}{2} \vec{a_n}$
## note that in all cases, $\large \vec D= \epsilon_o \vec E$
